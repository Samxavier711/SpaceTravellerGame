This project implements a Flappy Bird game where an agent learns to play using reinforcement learning. 
The agent, represented by a neural network, learns to navigate through the pipes by receiving feedback in 
the form of rewards.

Features
    - Reinforcement learning using [algorithm/library]
    - Neural network-based agent
    - Flappy Bird game environment
    - Training and evaluation scripts

We have used NEAT algorithm for reinforcement learning.

The NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) library in Python is a popular and powerful tool for 
implementing neuroevolution algorithms. Neuroevolution is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves 
evolving neural networks through evolutionary algorithms.

NEAT is particularly useful for evolving neural networks with varying architectures, allowing the algorithm
to discover complex and effective network structures. The key idea behind NEAT is to start with a populatio
of simple neural networks and evolve both the weights and structures of these networks over generations.
